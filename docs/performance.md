# Performance Deep Dive

This document explains why json is faster than existing parsers and the key optimizations that make it possible.

## GPU: 2x Faster than cuJSON

On NVIDIA B200 with 804MB `twitter_large_record.json`:

| Parser | Throughput | Time | Speedup |
|--------|------------|------|---------|
| cuJSON (CUDA C++) | 3.6 GB/s | 236 ms | baseline |
| **json GPU** | **7.0 GB/s** | **121 ms** | **2.0x** |

*Based on warmed-up runs. Pinned memory path (comparable scope to cuJSON).*

## Key Optimizations

| Optimization | Impact | Description |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| **GPU Stream Compaction** | 🔥 **Main speedup** | Reduces D2H transfer from ~160ms to minimal overhead |
| **Pinned Memory** | H2D: ~15ms | Uses `HostBuffer` for fast host-to-device transfer |
| **Hierarchical Prefix Sums** | GPU: efficient | Parallel scans using block primitives |
| **Fused Kernels** | Lower overhead | Single-pass quote detection + structural bitmap |

## Why json is Faster: The Stream Compaction Advantage

### The Problem with cuJSON

cuJSON transfers **all structural character data** back to CPU:

- Input: 804MB JSON file
- Structural chars: ~58% of input = **465MB transfer**
- D2H time: **~160ms** (bottleneck)

### json's Solution

json uses **GPU stream compaction** to extract only position indices:

- Input: 804MB JSON file
- Position array: ~1 million positions × 4 bytes = **4MB transfer**
- D2H time: **minimal** (116x smaller data transfer)

This is the primary reason for the 2x overall speedup.

## Detailed Timing Breakdown

## Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | cuJSON | json |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Input memory** | Pinned (cudaMallocHost) | Pinned (HostBuffer) |
| **H2D transfer** | ✓ (15ms) | ✓ (15ms) |
| **GPU kernels** | Validation + Tokenization | Quote detection + Prefix sums + Bitmap |
| **Position extraction** | ❌ (transfers all data) | ✅ **GPU stream compaction** |
| **D2H transfer** | 465MB (~160ms) | 4MB (~15ms) |
| **Bracket matching** | GPU (Parser kernel) | CPU (stack algorithm) |

## Performance Metrics Explained

`pixi run bench-gpu` reports a single `std.benchmark.Bench` table with
four rows so you can see where time goes across the pipeline:

| Row | What It Includes | Use Case |
|-----|------------------|----------|
| **from host bytes: memcpy + parse (wall-clock)** | host→pinned memcpy + `parse_json_gpu_from_pinned` | Realistic "bytes in memory → parsed" cost |
| **parse_json_gpu_from_pinned (pinned, wall-clock)** | H2D + GPU kernels + stream compaction + D2H + CPU bracket matching | Apples-to-apples comparison with cuJSON (both assume pinned input) |
| **parse_json_gpu_from_pinned (device-only)** | Same call, timed via `DeviceContext.execution_time` (CUDA events) | Pure device-queue time, excludes host-side CPU post-processing |
| **loads[target='gpu']** | Everything + `Value` tree construction on CPU | Real-world application performance |

### Why Four Rows?

1. **Pinned wall-clock (~121 ms, 7.0 GB/s):** apples-to-apples with cuJSON
   (both assume pinned input). This is the headline GPU-parse number.
2. **Pinned device-only (~100 ms, ~8 GB/s):** drops the host-side
   bracket-matching and list-build work. Use this to compare against
   kernel-only timings from other frameworks.
3. **from host bytes (~280 ms, ~2.9 GB/s):** adds the realistic
   host→pinned memcpy (~120 ms for 804 MB on DDR5).
4. **Full `loads[target='gpu']` (~900 ms, ~1.0 GB/s):** adds the
   CPU-bound `Value` tree construction on top of everything.

Pass `--debug-timing` to get a per-phase breakdown (H2D, GPU kernels,
position extraction, bracket matching, total) printed alongside the
summary table:

```bash
pixi run bench-gpu -- --debug-timing benchmark/datasets/twitter_large_record.json
```

## Benchmark Results

### GPU Performance (NVIDIA B200)

**Important:** GPU benchmarks are only meaningful for large files (>100MB). For smaller files, GPU launch overhead dominates and results are not representative of actual performance.

| Dataset | Size | Pinned Path | Speedup vs cuJSON |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| twitter_large_record.json | 804 MB | 7.0 GB/s | **2.0x** |

GPU parallelism shines with large files where the overhead is amortized.

## CPU Performance

json has three CPU code paths, all served by `loads(target='cpu')`:

| Path | DOM model | What it costs |
|---|---|---|
| **simd** (default) | Lazy v0.1 `Value`: arrays/objects store the raw substring, children are decoded on access | Cheap to parse, expensive (and sometimes incorrect) on traversal -- see below |
| **scalar** | Same lazy `Value` | Same trade-off, ~2x slower than simd because stage 1 is byte-by-byte |
| **tape** (`-D JSON_USE_TAPE_VALUE=1`) | Eager `Document` tape: every primitive becomes a typed tape entry at parse time | Slower to parse, **dramatically** faster on traversal, and correct on real-world JSON |
| simdjson (FFI) | C++ simdjson via the `target='cpu-simdjson'` shim | Reference parser at the cost of FFI marshalling |

### Two workloads, two answers

`pixi run -e dev bench-cpu <file>` reports both:

* `scalar` / `simd` / `tape` -- "parse, then peek the root with
  `is_object()`". Children are not touched, so the lazy paths get to
  short-circuit.
* `scalar_traverse` / `simd_traverse` / `tape_traverse` -- "parse, then
  recursively visit every value via the public API
  (`array_items` / `object_items` / `*_value`)". This is what almost
  any real consumer ends up doing.

#### Numbers (Apple Silicon, M-series, this dev box)

| Corpus | Size | simdjson C++ | simd (peek) | tape (peek) | simd_traverse | **tape_traverse** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `twitter.json` | 617 KB | 2.66 GB/s | 1.18 GB/s | 0.23 GB/s | 142.9 ms | **4.17 ms (34x faster)** |
| `citm_catalog.json` | 1.7 MB | 3.13 GB/s | 1.33 GB/s | 0.23 GB/s | **701 ms ❌ buggy** | **11.38 ms ✅ correct (62x faster)** |
| `twitter_large_record.json` | 804 MB | 1.47 GB/s | 0.73 GB/s | 0.15 GB/s | (not run; quadratic-ish) | (eager parse only -- bench measures `peek`) |

The `citm_catalog` row is the punchline: the lazy path raises
`Key not found in JSON object` mid-walk because `object_items()`
re-scans the raw substring for each key it remembered, and that
second scan can disagree with the first on documents with duplicate
keys or non-trivial escape patterns. **The tape path is the only one
that walks `citm_catalog` correctly**, and it does so 62x faster than
the (buggy) lazy walk on the same input.

Under the peek-only workload the lazy SIMD path lands at **~40-50 %
of native simdjson** in pure Mojo with zero FFI, and ~2x the simdjson
FFI shim because it sidesteps the marshalling round-trip. Under the
traversal workload the lazy paths fall off a cliff and tape wins
unambiguously.

### Why tape exists (and why it's the future default)

The lazy v0.1 representation was fast for "parse and ignore", which is
why it's still the entry-point default: existing code paths
(jsonpath, schema, patch, reflection, simdjson FFI) light up
unchanged. But its on-access re-parse model is the documented
silent-bug source: nested mutations don't propagate, duplicate keys
collapse, and traversal cost is super-linear. Every fix to those
makes the lazy path slower without making it correct.

The tape `Document` is the v0.2 design's answer:

* Each value gets exactly one tape entry. No re-parsing, no
  re-scanning, no key-collision lottery.
* Strings are stored as `(offset, length)` slices into the original
  input -- zero-copy when the bytes don't need unescaping.
* The GPU pipeline emits the same tape, so CPU and GPU now agree on
  one DOM representation.
* Because every `Value` is a stable index into the same tape,
  copy-on-write mutation can correctly propagate through nested
  containers (Phase 2d).

In other words: the bench's "tape is slow under peek" is paying for
correctness and post-parse traversal speed. The plan is to make tape
the default once we've audited the remaining callers; the
`-D JSON_USE_TAPE_VALUE=1` flag is the staged rollout, not a sign
that tape is optional.

## When to Use GPU vs CPU

| File Size | Recommended Backend | Reason |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| < 1 MB | **CPU (simdjson)** | GPU launch overhead dominates |
| 1-100 MB | **CPU or GPU** | Comparable performance |
| > 100 MB | **GPU** | 2x faster than cuJSON, 3-5x faster than CPU |

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. GPU Stream Compaction

**Problem:** After identifying structural characters on GPU, we need their positions on CPU for bracket matching.

**Naive approach:** Transfer entire structural character bitmap (58% of input size)

**Optimized approach:**
1. Create position bitmap on GPU
2. Use parallel prefix sum to compute output positions
3. Compact positions into dense array on GPU
4. Transfer only compact position array to CPU

**Result:** 116x reduction in D2H transfer size (465MB → 4MB)

### 2. Pinned Memory

Using `HostBuffer` (pinned memory) for H2D transfers:

- Pinned: ~15ms for 804MB
- Pageable: ~110ms for 804MB
- **Speedup:** 7.3x faster

### 3. Hierarchical Prefix Sums

For computing in-string regions, we use block-level prefix sums:

1. Each block computes local prefix sum using `block.prefix_sum`
2. Last value from each block propagates to next block
3. Single-pass algorithm, minimal synchronization

### 4. Fused Kernels

Combine multiple operations in single kernel launches:

- Quote detection + escape handling
- Structural character extraction + bitmap creation
- Reduces kernel launch overhead

### 5. Minimize Memory Allocations

- Pre-allocate GPU buffers based on input size
- Reuse `DeviceContext` across operations
- Use `String(unsafe_from_utf8=bytes^)` for bulk string construction

### 6. Hybrid GPU/CPU Pipeline

- **GPU:** Parallel bitmap operations (where GPU excels)
- **CPU:** Sequential bracket matching (where CPU is sufficient)
- **Key insight:** Don't force everything on GPU; use the right tool for each step

## Performance Variance

GPU performance can vary between runs due to:

- **Cold-start overhead:** First GPU run ~200ms slower (GPU initialization)
- **Thermal throttling:** GPU frequency varies with temperature
- **Scheduling:** CUDA stream scheduling can introduce variance

**Solution:** Always measure with warm-up runs and report averages.

## Future Optimizations

Potential improvements for even better performance:

1. **GPU bracket matching:** Could eliminate CPU bottleneck (~11ms)
2. **Multi-GPU support:** For files > 1GB
3. **Streaming parser:** Process chunks as they arrive
4. **Zero-copy Value tree:** Build tree directly on GPU memory
