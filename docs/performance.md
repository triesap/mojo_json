# Performance Deep Dive

This document explains why json is faster than existing parsers and the key optimizations that make it possible.

## GPU: lean pipeline across NVIDIA / AMD / Apple

On NVIDIA B200 with 804 MB `twitter_large_record.json` (same lean
pipeline runs on AMD MI355X and Apple Metal):

| Parser | Throughput | Time | Notes |
|--------|------------|------|---|
| cuJSON (CUDA C++) | 3.6 GB/s | 236 ms | baseline |
| **json GPU (pinned wall-clock)** | **~6.5 GB/s** | **~130 ms** | what `bench-gpu` reports |

*Based on warmed-up runs (3 + 100). Reproduce with `pixi run -e dev
bench-gpu benchmark/datasets/twitter_large_record.json`; pass
`--debug-timing` for the per-phase breakdown.*

## Key Optimizations

| Optimization | Impact | Description |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| **GPU Stream Compaction** | 🔥 **Main speedup** | Reduces D2H transfer from ~160 MB to ~4 MB of position indices |
| **Pinned Memory** | H2D: ~15 ms | Uses `HostBuffer` for fast host-to-device transfer |
| **Lean pipeline** | unifies all backends | One fused kernel + positions-only stream compaction. No popcount + hierarchical prefix-sum cascade (the in-string mask is applied CPU-side by the tape adapter, byte-by-byte), no `pair_pos` array (the tape adapter does not need bracket pairs), no `char_types` companion stream out of the GPU. Same pipeline on NVIDIA, AMD, and Apple Metal. |
| **Fused Kernel** | Lower overhead | Single kernel emits both the `{}[]:,` structural bitmap and the `{}[]` open-close bitmap. |

## Why json is Faster: The Stream Compaction Advantage

### The Problem with cuJSON

cuJSON transfers **all structural character data** back to CPU:

- Input: 804MB JSON file
- Structural chars: ~58% of input = **465MB transfer**
- D2H time: **~160ms** (bottleneck)

### json's Solution

json uses **GPU stream compaction** to extract only position indices:

- Input: 804MB JSON file
- Position array: ~1 million positions × 4 bytes = **4MB transfer**
- D2H time: **minimal** (116x smaller data transfer)

This is the primary reason for the 2x overall speedup.

## Detailed Timing Breakdown

### cuJSON Pipeline (~236ms total)

```
cuJSON breakdown (average):
├─ H2D transfer:       ~15 ms   (804MB → GPU)
├─ Validation:          ~2 ms   (GPU)
├─ Tokenization:        ~6 ms   (GPU)
├─ Parser:              ~2 ms   (GPU)
└─ D2H transfer:      ~160 ms   (465MB → CPU, bottleneck)
────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                ~236 ms
Throughput:           3.6 GB/s
```

### json GPU Pipeline (~130 ms total, lean)

```
json pinned breakdown (B200):
├─ H2D + alloc:       ~15 ms   (804 MB → GPU, pinned memory + buffer alloc)
├─ Fused kernel:       ~2 ms   ({}[]:,/{}[]  bitmaps in one launch)
├─ Stream compact:    ~95 ms   (popcount + block prefix sum + scatter, positions-only)
└─ D2H + finalize:    ~17 ms   (~4 MB positions → CPU + JSONResult fill)
────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:               ~130 ms
Throughput:           ~6.5 GB/s (pinned wall-clock)
```

There is no GPU-side in-string mask and no CPU bracket-matching
pass. The tape adapter walks the byte stream once to apply the
escape state machine and stage 2 directly consumes
`gpu_result.structural`; `pair_pos` is left as a placeholder for
legacy iterator ABI compatibility.

## Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | cuJSON | json |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Input memory** | Pinned (cudaMallocHost) | Pinned (HostBuffer) |
| **H2D transfer** | ✓ (15 ms) | ✓ (15 ms) |
| **GPU kernels** | Validation + Tokenization | Single fused kernel emits `{}[]:,` + `{}[]` bitmaps |
| **Position extraction** | ❌ (transfers all data) | ✅ **GPU stream compaction (positions only)** |
| **D2H transfer** | 465 MB (~160 ms) | 4 MB (~15 ms) |
| **Bracket / pair-match** | GPU (Parser kernel) | not done -- the tape adapter walks the byte stream once on the CPU and does not need a `pair_pos` array |

## Performance Metrics Explained

`pixi run bench-gpu` reports a single `std.benchmark.Bench` table with
four rows so you can see where time goes across the pipeline:

| Row | What It Includes | Use Case |
|-----|------------------|----------|
| **from host bytes: memcpy + parse (wall-clock)** | host→pinned memcpy + `parse_json_gpu_from_pinned` | Realistic "bytes in memory → parsed" cost |
| **parse_json_gpu_from_pinned (pinned, wall-clock)** | H2D + GPU kernels + stream compaction + D2H + CPU bracket matching | Apples-to-apples comparison with cuJSON (both assume pinned input) |
| **parse_json_gpu_from_pinned (device-only)** | Same call, timed via `DeviceContext.execution_time` (CUDA events) | Pure device-queue time, excludes host-side CPU post-processing |
| **loads[target='gpu']** | Everything + `Value` tree construction on CPU | Real-world application performance |

### Why Four Rows?

1. **Pinned wall-clock (~121 ms, 7.0 GB/s):** apples-to-apples with cuJSON
   (both assume pinned input). This is the headline GPU-parse number.
2. **Pinned device-only (~100 ms, ~8 GB/s):** drops the host-side
   bracket-matching and list-build work. Use this to compare against
   kernel-only timings from other frameworks.
3. **from host bytes (~280 ms, ~2.9 GB/s):** adds the realistic
   host→pinned memcpy (~120 ms for 804 MB on DDR5).
4. **Full `loads[target='gpu']` (~900 ms, ~1.0 GB/s):** adds the
   CPU-bound `Value` tree construction on top of everything.

Pass `--debug-timing` to get a per-phase breakdown (H2D, GPU kernels,
position extraction, bracket matching, total) printed alongside the
summary table:

```bash
pixi run bench-gpu -- --debug-timing benchmark/datasets/twitter_large_record.json
```

## Benchmark Results

### GPU Performance

GPU benchmarks are only meaningful for large files (>100 MB). For
smaller files, GPU launch overhead dominates and the results are
not representative.

804 MB `twitter_large_record.json`:

| Platform | Throughput | Pipeline |
|---|---:|---|
| AMD MI355X | 13 GB/s | lean (single-shot) |
| NVIDIA B200 | ~6.5 GB/s | lean (single-shot, pinned wall-clock) |
| Apple M3 Pro | 3.1 GB/s | lean Metal (chunked at 64 MB) |

All backends run the same lean pipeline: one fused kernel + a
positions-only stream-compaction extract. The GPU does not build an
in-string mask and does not produce a `char_types` companion stream
(which would have been a ~66 MB D2H copy on `twitter_large_record`).
`gpu/tape_adapter.mojo` walks the byte stream once on the CPU to
apply the escape state machine and feeds stage 2 of the CPU pipeline
to construct the tape -- the same stage 2 the CPU-only path uses.

## CPU Performance

json has one CPU code path served by `loads(target='cpu')`: a pure
Mojo two-pass parser that emits a packed `Document` tape. Stage 1
finds structural positions; stage 2 walks them and writes typed
tape entries. SIMD stage 1 is the default; opt into the scalar
oracle with `parse_cpu_native_tape[force_scalar=True]` (it exists
mainly to validate the SIMD path under fuzzing).

`Value` is a tape-backed view over the resulting `Document`,
sharing it via `ArcPointer`. Children are computed by walking
`Document.tape` -- there is no on-access re-parse, no raw
substring rescan, and no duplicate-key collapse. Strings are stored
as `(offset, length)` slices into the original input and only
materialise an owned `String` when the bytes need unescaping or the
caller asks for one.

The GPU pipeline emits the same `Document` shape, so CPU and GPU
agree on one DOM representation; mutation propagates correctly
through nested containers because every `Value` is just a stable
index into the same tape.

### Benchmark methodology

`pixi run -e dev bench-cpu <file>` reports the same `simdjson` C++
parser as the reference, then the Mojo parser, both under the same
protocol:

* **3 warmup + 100 measured iterations** per workload.
* Throughput reported as **min-time-derived GB/s** (matches the
  upstream simdjson convention).
* Mojo's parser consumes its input by value, so the bench loop
  pre-builds a `List[String]` of independent copies outside the
  timed region. The simdjson side reuses one buffer because its
  parser does not consume the input.
* Mojo bench binaries are built with `mojo build -D ASSERT=none`,
  which strips the Mojo stdlib's safety asserts (the default
  `ASSERT=safe` keeps them in for development). This matches
  simdjson C++'s `-O3` posture; running with the default
  `ASSERT=safe` build is roughly 20-37% slower on these workloads
  and is not an apples-to-apples comparison. `pixi run -e dev
  bench-cpu` already wires the flag in.

Two workloads:

* **`parse_only`** -- `loads(...)` and peek the root tag. Measures
  parse cost in isolation. The compiler can't elide the parse
  because the root tag is touched.
* **`parse_traverse`** -- parse and recursively visit every leaf
  via the public API (`array_items` / `object_items` / `*_value`).
  This is what real consumers do, and on the tape representation
  it adds only a small constant on top of `parse_only`.

### Numbers (x86 host, Mojo native two-pass)

| Corpus | Size | `parse_only` (simd) | `parse_traverse` (simd) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `twitter.json` | 616 KB | 0.598 ms / 1.06 GB/s | 0.985 ms / 0.64 GB/s |
| `citm_catalog.json` | 1.7 MB | 1.109 ms / 1.56 GB/s | 1.980 ms / 0.87 GB/s |

* The Mojo `parse_traverse` cost is ~2x the `parse_only` cost --
  traversal walks every tape slot and materializes zero-copy keys
  / strings on demand. There is no on-access re-parse, no raw
  substring rescan, and no per-iteration allocation other than the
  document itself.
* simdjson's `target='cpu-simdjson'` FFI shim is intentionally not
  in this table; the FFI marshalling cost dominates and it has not
  been competitive with the native Mojo path for several releases.
  The simdjson C++ reference baseline is reproducible via
  `pixi run -e dev bench-cpu <file>`, which runs the simdjson C++
  binary first and then the Mojo parser under the same protocol.

### Key CPU optimizations

Stage 1 (structural indexing) -- now ~5+ GB/s in isolation:

1. **PSHUFB-style nibble classifier** -- a single
   `SIMD._dynamic_shuffle` pair plus an OR replaces the per-byte
   `eq` chain that classified `{ } [ ] : , " \\` and whitespace.
2. **Branchless 64-byte chunks** -- with `prefix_xor64` and
   `find_escape_mask64` (the simdjson-style escape / in-string
   branchless propagation), we process 64 bytes per iteration with
   no per-marker scalar dispatch in the common case.
3. **Two fast paths** -- chunks with no markers and no active
   string state skip all bit-twiddling; chunks with no quotes /
   backslashes and no active string emit structurals directly
   without escape computation.

Stage 2 (tape emission):

4. **Zero-copy clean strings and keys** -- `TAPE_TAG_STRING` and
   `TAPE_TAG_KEY_INLINE` store `(offset, length)` slices into
   `Document.input`. No allocation, no `memcpy`, no
   `string_pool` / `key_pool` append on the hot path. Only
   strings / keys that actually contain escapes spill to the
   side pools.
5. **SWAR 8-digit integer parser** -- 8 ASCII digit bytes loaded
   as a `SIMD[UInt8, 8]`, multiplied by a power-of-10 vector,
   reduced with a single `reduce_add`. Compiles to a tight NEON
   `umlal+addv` sequence; AVX2 gets `vpmulld+horizontal sum`.
6. **SIMD backslash scan** -- the scalar "does this string contain
   `\\`?" loop is replaced with a 32-byte `eq+reduce_or` scan,
   exiting on the first chunk in the no-escape case.
7. **SIMD whitespace skip with scalar prelude** -- 4-byte scalar
   prelude for the dense-JSON case (0-3 ws bytes), then a 32-byte
   SIMD body using `pack_bits` + `count_trailing_zeros` for
   pretty-printed whitespace runs.
8. **Bulk `memcpy` flush** -- when a container closes, its
   children's headers are copied from `headers_scratch` into
   `doc.tape` in one `memcpy` instead of one append per header.

### What's left to close the gap

The remaining gap on `parse_only` is algorithmic:

1. **No Eisel-Lemire float fast path.** `_emit_number` still spills
   to `atof` for floats. Eisel-Lemire would parse most floats
   without allocation; integer parsing already uses SWAR.
2. **Stage 2 still re-validates byte content** between adjacent
   structurals to reject inputs like `[1foo, 2]`. simdjson trusts
   stage 1's structural index fully; doing the same here would
   remove the per-value `_skip_ws` re-scan but requires stage 1 to
   detect non-whitespace, non-structural bytes outside strings.
3. **AVX-512 64-byte chunks** are not yet enabled on hosts that
   support `vpternlogq`; the 32-byte NEON / AVX2 path is what we
   measure today.

## When to Use GPU vs CPU

| File Size | Recommended Backend | Reason |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| < 1 MB | **CPU (simdjson)** | GPU launch overhead dominates |
| 1-100 MB | **CPU or GPU** | Comparable performance |
| > 100 MB | **GPU** | 2x faster than cuJSON, 3-5x faster than CPU |

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. GPU Stream Compaction

**Problem:** After identifying structural characters on GPU, we need their positions on CPU for bracket matching.

**Naive approach:** Transfer entire structural character bitmap (58% of input size)

**Optimized approach:**
1. Create position bitmap on GPU
2. Use parallel prefix sum to compute output positions
3. Compact positions into dense array on GPU
4. Transfer only compact position array to CPU

**Result:** 116x reduction in D2H transfer size (465MB → 4MB)

### 2. Pinned Memory

Using `HostBuffer` (pinned memory) for H2D transfers:

- Pinned: ~15ms for 804MB
- Pageable: ~110ms for 804MB
- **Speedup:** 7.3x faster

### 3. Block-level Prefix Sums (stream compaction)

The positions-only stream compaction needs an exclusive prefix sum
over per-word popcounts so each thread knows where to scatter its
positions:

1. Each block computes a local prefix sum using `block.prefix_sum`.
2. Block totals are propagated up the hierarchy and added back into
   per-block prefixes.
3. Single-pass algorithm, minimal synchronization.

### 4. Fused Kernel

A single kernel walks 32 input bytes per thread and emits two
32-bit-per-thread bitmaps:

- The raw `{}[]:,` structural bitmap consumed by stream compaction.
- The `{}[]` open-close bitmap (reserved for downstream use).

In-string detection lives on the CPU side
(`gpu/tape_adapter._result_to_index`), where the same byte walk that
stage 2 already needs runs the correct escape state machine.

### 5. Minimize Memory Allocations

- Pre-allocate GPU buffers based on input size
- Reuse `DeviceContext` across operations
- Use `String(unsafe_from_utf8=bytes^)` for bulk string construction

### 6. Hybrid GPU/CPU Pipeline

- **GPU:** parallel bitmap operations + stream compaction.
- **CPU:** the escape state machine + tape construction in the
  existing stage 2 pass.
- **Key insight:** keep the GPU on the work it parallelises well
  (structural classification + scatter), and let the CPU handle
  byte-by-byte state that doesn't parallelise cleanly inside a
  single 32-byte chunk.

## Performance Variance

GPU performance can vary between runs due to:

- **Cold-start overhead:** First GPU run ~200ms slower (GPU initialization)
- **Thermal throttling:** GPU frequency varies with temperature
- **Scheduling:** CUDA stream scheduling can introduce variance

**Solution:** Always measure with warm-up runs and report averages.

## Future Optimizations

Potential improvements for even better performance:

1. **Apple UMA-aware single-buffer pipeline:** drop the H2D leg on
   unified-memory hosts by writing directly into a unified-memory
   `DeviceBuffer`.
2. **Multi-GPU / multi-stream overlap:** launch the next chunk's
   H2D while the previous chunk's kernel runs.
3. **Streaming parser:** Process chunks as they arrive.
4. **Zero-copy Value tree:** Build tree directly on GPU memory.
