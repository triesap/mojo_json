# json Benchmarks

Comprehensive benchmarks comparing json against reference implementations (cuJSON for GPU, simdjson for CPU).

## Quick Start

```bash
# GPU benchmark (json vs cuJSON) - apples-to-apples comparison
pixi run bench-gpu-cujson benchmark/datasets/twitter_large_record.json

# GPU benchmark (json only, 4-row Bench report)
pixi run bench-gpu benchmark/datasets/twitter_large_record.json

# GPU benchmark with per-phase timing breakdown
pixi run bench-gpu -- --debug-timing benchmark/datasets/twitter_large_record.json

# CPU benchmark (json vs simdjson)
pixi run bench-cpu benchmark/datasets/twitter.json
```

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ehsanmok/json.git
cd json
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pixi install  # Installs Mojo + libsimdjson (from conda-forge), builds FFI wrapper
```

### 3. Build cuJSON (for GPU comparison benchmarks)

cuJSON is not bundled. Clone it manually into `benchmark/cuJSON`, then
build via the dev feature (which provides `git` and the nvcc wrapper
tasks; nvcc itself must be on PATH from your CUDA install):

```bash
cd benchmark && git clone https://github.com/AutomataLab/cuJSON.git
cd .. && pixi run -e dev build-cujson
```

This builds `benchmark/cuJSON/build/cujson_benchmark`. Tested against
cuJSON commit `2ac7d3dcd7ad1ff64ebdb14022bf94c59b3b4953`.

## Benchmark Results

### GPU: json vs cuJSON (NVIDIA B200)

**Dataset:** 804MB `twitter_large_record.json`

| Parser | Time | Throughput | Speedup |
|--------|------|------------|---------|
| cuJSON (CUDA C++) | 182 ms | 4.6 GB/s | baseline |
| **json GPU** | **103 ms** | **8.2 GB/s** | **1.8x** |

### CPU: Mojo native (default) vs simdjson C++ (Apple Silicon, M-series)

`pixi run -e dev bench-cpu <file>` runs the native `simdjson` C++
parser, then the Mojo CPU parser (scalar + SIMD stage 1 variants).
Both benches share the same protocol:

* 3 warmup + 100 measured iterations.
* Throughput reported as min-time-derived GB/s.
* Mojo's parser consumes its input by value, so the bench loop
  pre-builds a `List[String]` of independent copies outside the
  timed region. The simdjson side reuses one buffer because its
  parser does not consume the input.

Two workloads per parser:

* **`parse_only`** -- `loads(...)` and peek the root tag.
* **`parse_traverse`** -- parse + recursively visit every leaf via
  the public `Value` API (the realistic workload).

| Corpus | Size | simdjson `parse_only` | mojo `parse_only` (simd) | simdjson `parse_traverse` | mojo `parse_traverse` (simd) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `twitter.json` | 616 KB | 0.235 ms / 2.68 GB/s | 0.54 ms / 1.17 GB/s | 0.236 ms / 2.67 GB/s | 1.12 ms / 0.57 GB/s |
| `citm_catalog.json` | 1.7 MB | 0.440 ms / 3.92 GB/s | 1.09 ms / 1.58 GB/s | 0.528 ms / 3.27 GB/s | 2.49 ms / 0.69 GB/s |

The Mojo `parse_traverse` cost is ~2x the `parse_only` cost on
both corpora -- traversal walks every tape slot and materializes
zero-copy keys/strings on demand. There is no on-access re-parse,
no raw substring rescan, and no per-iteration allocation other
than the document itself.

The remaining gap to native `simdjson` is ~2.3-2.5x on
`parse_only` and ~4-5x on `parse_traverse`. The parse-only gap is
algorithmic: simdjson's tape walker dispatches on a single
indexed-into-positions byte read with no recursion, while ours
still uses recursive `_emit_value` calls and re-validates byte
content for some edge cases. The traverse delta is dominated by
the cost of materializing `Value` views and copying string slices
out of the input on read. See
[docs/performance.md](../docs/performance.md) for the breakdown.

The `target='cpu-simdjson'` FFI shim is intentionally not in this
table; its FFI marshalling cost dominates and it has not been
competitive with the native Mojo path for several releases.

## Important: GPU Benchmarks Require Large Files

**GPU benchmarks are only meaningful for files >100MB.** For smaller files, GPU launch overhead dominates and results are misleading. Always use large datasets (e.g., `twitter_large_record.json`) for GPU performance evaluation.

## Note: Pixi Tasks Build Binaries Automatically

The pixi benchmark tasks automatically build binaries with `mojo build` before running (via `depends-on`). This avoids JIT compilation overhead that would skew results.

```bash
# Pixi tasks handle the build automatically
pixi run bench-gpu benchmark/datasets/twitter_large_record.json

# First run may have GPU initialization overhead - subsequent runs are faster
```

## Benchmarking Methodology

### What We Measure

`pixi run bench-gpu` emits a single `std.benchmark.Bench` report with four
rows so you can see where time goes across the GPU pipeline:

| Row | What It Includes | Use Case |
|-----|------------------|----------|
| **from host bytes: memcpy + parse (wall-clock)** | host→pinned memcpy + `parse_json_gpu_from_pinned` | Realistic steady-state "I have N bytes in memory, parse them via GPU" |
| **parse_json_gpu_from_pinned (pinned, wall-clock)** | H2D + GPU kernels + stream compaction + D2H + CPU bracket matching | Apples-to-apples comparison with cuJSON (both assume pinned input) |
| **parse_json_gpu_from_pinned (device-only)** | Same call, timed via `DeviceContext.execution_time` (CUDA events) | Pure device-queue time, excludes host-side CPU post-processing |
| **loads[target='gpu']** | Everything + `Value` tree construction on CPU | Real-world application performance |

Pass `--debug-timing` to get a per-phase breakdown inside each
`parse_json_gpu*` call (H2D, GPU kernels, position extraction, bracket
matching, total). The flag is a runtime argv parse, no recompile needed.

```bash
pixi run bench-gpu -- --debug-timing benchmark/datasets/twitter_large_record.json
```

### Apples-to-Apples Comparison with cuJSON

[cuJSON](https://github.com/AutomataLab/cuJSON) is the state-of-the-art GPU JSON parser from the academic literature. Our benchmark uses the exact same scope as cuJSON's benchmark to ensure fair comparison.

#### What Both Benchmarks Measure

| Step | cuJSON | json |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Input memory** | Pinned (cudaMallocHost) | Pinned (HostBuffer) |
| **H2D transfer** | ✓ (copy to GPU) | ✓ (copy to GPU) |
| **GPU processing** | Validation + Tokenization + Parser | Quote detection + Prefix sums + Bitmap + Stream compaction |
| **Bracket matching** | GPU (Parser kernel) | CPU (stack algorithm) |
| **D2H transfer** | ✓ (465MB structural data) | ✓ (4MB position indices) |
| **Output** | Structural positions + bracket pairs | Structural positions + bracket pairs |

Both parsers produce the same output: an array of structural character positions and their corresponding bracket pair mappings. This is what's needed for downstream JSON tree construction.

#### Detailed Timing Breakdown (804MB file)

```
cuJSON (182ms total):                json pinned (103ms total):
├─ H2D transfer:     15.2 ms         ├─ H2D transfer:      ~15 ms
├─ Validation:        1.5 ms         ├─ GPU kernels:       ~25 ms
├─ Tokenization:      5.5 ms         │  ├─ Quote detection
├─ Parser (GPU):      1.4 ms         │  ├─ Prefix sums
└─ D2H transfer:    158.6 ms         │  └─ Structural bitmap
                                      ├─ Stream compaction: ~45 ms (GPU)
                                      ├─ D2H transfer:      ~10 ms (4MB)
                                      └─ Bracket matching:  ~10 ms (CPU)
────────────────────────────         ────────────────────────────────
Throughput: 4.6 GB/s                 Throughput: 8.2 GB/s
```

### Why json is Faster

The **1.8x speedup** comes primarily from **GPU stream compaction**:

- **cuJSON approach:** Transfer all structural character data back to CPU
  - Structural chars = ~58% of input = 465MB for 804MB file
  - D2H transfer time: ~160ms

- **json approach:** Use GPU stream compaction to extract only positions
  - Position array = ~1M positions × 4 bytes = 4MB
  - D2H transfer time: ~10ms

**Speedup:** 16x reduction in D2H transfer size → 3.2x faster D2H → 1.8x overall speedup

### What About the "from host bytes" Row?

The "from host bytes" row adds the realistic cost of getting your bytes
onto the GPU. It reuses a long-lived `DeviceContext` and pinned
`HostBuffer` across iterations (as any real application would) and
measures `memcpy(pinned <- host)` + `parse_json_gpu_from_pinned`:

| Metric | Time | Throughput | Notes |
|--------|------|------------|-------|
| cuJSON (from pinned) | 182 ms | 4.6 GB/s | Assumes input is already pinned |
| json pinned (wall-clock) | 103 ms | 8.2 GB/s | Same assumption (fair comparison) |
| json "from host bytes" | ~280 ms | ~2.9 GB/s | Realistic scenario with host→pinned memcpy |

The host→pinned copy is the dominant extra cost (~100-150 ms for 804 MB
on DDR5). In practice you can avoid it by:
1. Reading files directly into a `HostBuffer` (pinned memory)
2. Memory-mapping files into pinned memory
3. Using network/RDMA buffers that are already pinned

### End-to-End Performance

For real applications using the full `loads[target='gpu']()` API:

| Pipeline Stage | Time (804 MB) |
|----------------|---------------|
| `parse_json_gpu_from_pinned` | ~150 ms |
| host→pinned memcpy | ~120 ms |
| Value tree construction (CPU) | ~600 ms |
| **Total** | **~900 ms** |
| **Throughput** | **~1.0 GB/s** |

The `Value` tree construction is currently CPU-bound; it's the largest
slice of the full-pipeline budget. Use `parse_json_gpu_from_pinned`
directly if you only need the structural position array and can build
your own downstream representation.

## Performance Tips

### For Best GPU Performance

1. **Use pinned memory:** Pre-allocate with `HostBuffer` for H2D transfers
2. **Large files only:** GPU overhead dominates for files <1MB
3. **Warm-up runs:** First GPU kernel launch has one-time initialization overhead
4. **Batch processing:** Reuse `DeviceContext` across multiple parses

### For Best CPU Performance

1. **Small files:** CPU is faster than GPU for files <1MB
2. **Memory-mapped files:** For very large files, use memory mapping
3. **Batch processing:** Parse multiple files in parallel with threading

## Troubleshooting

### "CUDA out of memory"
- Reduce file size or use CPU backend
- Close other GPU applications
- Check available GPU memory with `nvidia-smi`

### "cuJSON benchmark not found"
- Run `pixi run -e dev build-cujson` first (the task lives in the dev feature)
- Check that CUDA toolkit is installed

### "Failed to create DeviceContext"
- Verify GPU is available: `nvidia-smi`
- Check CUDA installation
- Ensure Mojo has GPU support (nightly build)
